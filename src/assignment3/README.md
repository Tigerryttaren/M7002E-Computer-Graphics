Assignment 3
=======================
### Disclaimer
The controls and the general player concept was inspired from the **HelloCollisions.java** example, and crosshairs were taken pretty straight off from **HelloPhysics.java**.

### "Features" 
#### Occational World Breach
In some cases, a box that has gained significant speed or torque might penetrate the ceiling or ground due to *awesome* forces.

### Required Features Implemented
##### Creating an Enclosed Enviromnent
An enclosed room with a floor, a roof and four walls was created. All of the are solid and will not let the player pass through them.

##### Model Creation
I chose to create the models programatically and add some fancy textures. 

##### Instancing
The crates, drones and most objects are created by calling a method that takes the properties as input. One can easily instanciate several objects.

##### Smooth Motion
In front of HAL9000, there are three crates that can be manipulated to fidget around. Also, in the ceiling there are three surveilance drones that will move following a path when the user presses buttons.

### Instructions

##### Heroic Player 
Use the **WASD** and **SPACE** keys to move around the environment, as well as **MOUSE** or **ARROW** keys to move the camera.

##### Small Crates
Use the **1** key to manipulate one of the crates, and use the **2** and **3** keys to manipulate the ovther two. Only the small crates can be manipulated. 

##### Red Rubber Ball
Use the **B** key to make the red rubber ball bounce.

##### Surveilance Drones
Use the **7** key to make one of the drones move, and the **8** and **9** keys to move the other two drones.

### Texture References
