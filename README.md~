M7002E-Computer-Graphics
========================
Student project for the course M7002E Computer Graphics With Virtual Environments at Luleå Tekniska Universitet

Lab 1
=========================
Features implemented:
• Draws the outline of a square based pyramid.
• Draws a filled in blue square.
• Draws a green star (any kind of star you want).
• Has code that allows you to easily create additional squares, stars, and pyramids.
• Preserves the openGL state, therefore your openGL commands will need to be encapsulated
in a way that the openGL state before one of your shapes is drawn, is preserved after the
shape is drawn. See glPushAttrib(), glPushMatrix(), glPopAttrib(), glPopMatrix().
