M7002E Computer Graphics With Virtual Environments
=================================================
Student project at Lule√• Tekniska Universitet.

Lab 1
=======================
Required features implemented:

**Outlines of a Square-based Pyramid** 
The outlines of a red square based pyramid has been drawn. 

**Blue Filled-in Square**

A blue filled in square has been drawn.

**Any Kind of Green Star**


A green star has been drawn. A four-pointed star was chosen because it is very easy do draw compared to a five-pointed star, for example. 

##### Easy Creation of Additional Figures
The code was designed so that the drawing of the figures are done in functions, which can easily be called on to make additional figures. 

##### Preserves the OpenGL State
The functions *glPushAttrib()*, *glPushMatrix()*, *glPopAttrib()*, and *glPopMatrix()* was used  for preserving the openGL state before translating or rotating the figures, and also before changing attributes such as colors.
